## Design changes
- Initially the navigation bar was under the header image, but the image was too big, so that I decided to move menu to the top of the page. I tried a couple of images, before I chose the best one. Accordingly to the image the color scheme was changing. At some point to make the website more informative the video was added.

## Future features
- To popularize learning of zen buddhism I am planning to create another page with zen videos and lectures for our users who will buy yearly subscription.
