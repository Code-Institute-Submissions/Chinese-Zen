                    As to Hui-neng's early years, only his relationship with Hung-jen can be regarded as historically certain.
                    Since, according to the chronicles, he arrived at Wang-mei at the age of twenty four, the year of his eight
                    months' stay with Hung-jen can be fixed at 661. He had quickly obtained enlightenment and status, and now 
                    he returned to South China as the Sixth Patriarch. The next sixteen years he spent in the seclusion of his
                    native mountains. We should note that at this time he had not yet forsworn the world to become a monk but 
                    continued life as a layman, nor was he as yet engaged in teaching.  
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    In the year 676 Hui-neng was ordained a monk, and the following year he returned to the monastery of Pao-lin-ssu, 
                    at Ts'ao-ch'i in Kuang-tung Province, where he had stayed earlier. He now lectured regularly in the great Brahman 
                    temple of that city. His words carried the note of a new proclamation, and disciples streamed in from all directions. 
                    He turned down an invitation to the imperial court (705) which had been obtained for him by his colleague and rival, 
                    Shen-hsiu. Surrounded by his disciples, he died in his near by native place, where, thanks to the favor of the Emperor,
                    his old dwelling had been transformed into a temple. The Sutra Spoken by the Sixth Patriarch from the High Seat of the 
                    Gem of the Law contains, in addition to the core of his lectures in the great Brahman temple, his final instructions to 
                    his disciples and anaccount of his death.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    There is the same lack of immediate and reliable sources for the teachings of Hui-neng. The authentic old fragments in the 
                    first half of the sutra, which literary criticism still has to extricate from the accompanying glosses, must be closest to 
                    his spirit. His commentary on the Diamond Sutra and the conversations with his disciples likewise present fragments of his 
                    thoughts. The basic texts of the southern sect further include the lectures and the inspired sermon of Shen-hui, whose 
                    ideas are in full harmony with the Hui-neng sutra. At every point Shen-hui bases himself on Hui-neng, who is regarded by all 
                    representatives of the southern sect as founder and final authority. But just how much of the classical Zen metaphysics 
                    actually derives from Hui-neng's own genius, and how much of it was added by later disciples or was taken over from precursors, 
                    is difficult to determine. In any event, these early basic texts of the southern sect contain the complete Zen doctrine of 
                    enlightenment.

                    The period from the death of Hui-neng in 713 until the persecution of Buddhism under the Emperor Wu-tsung (845) was the 
                    Golden Age of Chinese Zen, on which the chronicles, sayings, and koan collections of later times present almost 
                    unlimited materials. It was the time of those original Zen masters who in spiritual exaltation expressed their inexpressible 
                    experiences in ever new ways and paradoxical twists. The originality of these utterances stands in striking contrast to the 
                    monotony of the air content. These vigorous and exuberant men thrust away all methods so as to be carried freely by the storm 
                    of the spirit. Endowed with an amazing facility of speech, they enriched the religious-mystical vocabulary with new terms 
                    which mock at reason and defy translation. During this period as well, Zen exerted a growing influence on Chinese culture.
                </p>
                <p class="text background">
                    Ma-tsu (707-786) was the dominant figure during the third generation after Hui-neng. As a follower of Huai-jang (677-744) 
                    he stood in the mainstream of Chinese Zen out of which arose the powerful Rinzai sect. He was the first to use shouting, known 
                    as katsu (Chin.: ho; Jap.: katsu), as a means to bring the disciple to enlightenment, as a means later made famous by Lin-chi 
                    (Jap.: Rinzai).
                </p>
                <p class="text background">
                    Another typical figure among the Zen masters of the T'ang period is Te-shan (780-865), who stands in the tradition of Hsing-ssu 
                    (d. 740), the first among the disciples of Hui-neng. Te-shan came from North China. He was well versed in Buddhist learning, 
                    above all in the doctrine of Supreme Wisdomand in the Diamond Sutra. Reports about the flourishing Zen life in the South aroused 
                    painful doubts in his mind. Was it notculpable presumption to eschew the study of the sutras and toaspire to Buddhahood simply 
                    by seeing into one's own nature? For to grasp the truth, even with the help of the sacred scriptures, was an arduous undertaking. 
                    So, in a hostile mood, he set out for the South to combat these frivolous innovations. On his way he met an old woman who gave the 
                    first jolt to his trust in sutra knowledge, and directed him to the master Lungfan. According to the Wu-men-kuan, the woman asked 
                    Te-shan, who wanted to buy some refreshment from her, 'Tour Excellency, what are those writings you are carrying in your knapsack?" 
                    Te-shan replied, "The Commentaries on the Diamond Sutra." Thereupon the woman said, "In the sutra it is written, 'The consciousness 
                    of the past is inexpressible, the consciousness of the present is inexpressible, the consciousness of the future is inexpressible.' 
                    What consciousness do you wish to refresh?" To this Te-shan could give no answer, but following the woman's advice he walked the 
                    five miles to the home of Lung-t'an. There, as the master blew out the candle and darkness settled about him, the eye of enlightenment 
                    opened to Te-shan instantaneously. The next day he went out and burned the sutras.

                <h2 id="Life" class="headers">The Monastic Life</h2>
                <p class="text">

                    All life requires form and, if it is genuine, will create forms thatare appropriate to it. During the heyday of Zen in the Tangperiod, 
                    the monastic rule of Pai-chang (749-814), which regulated the life of the Zen monks, was developed. While in India"a robe and a bowl 
                    on a stone under a tree" was adequate to the meager needs of a mendicant, in China, with its morerigorous climate and different customs, 
                    such simplicity did not suffice. In the earliest years of Chinese Zen, Tao-hsin had already set up certain rules for the life of his 
                    five hundred disciples, which stipulated that they should do manual work in order to supply their daily needs. Thus we see Hui-neng, 
                    thenewcomer from the South, engaged for eight months in splitting wood and treading the rice mill in the monastery of the Fifth Patriarch, 
                    Hung-jen.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The main precept of the rules is manual labor, a principle pregnantly formulated by Pai-chang: "A day without work - a day without 
                    eating." The master put the greatest value on having his monks work, and he himself set the best example. Even at an advanced age, he still 
                    insisted on working in the garden. When members of the community, concerned for his welfare, took his tools away, he refused to eat until he 
                    was again permitted to work.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Pai-chang's rules regulate the arrangement of the buildings, the hierarchy of offices, the special ascetic practices throughout the year, and 
                    the penalties for infringing the rules. They also prescribe in detail the daily routine of the monk's life. Meditation, worship, and manual 
                    labor alternate. During the periods of ascetic practice the monks sleep in the meditation hall, where each performs his meditation at his 
                    assigned place and takes his meals according to a fixed ritual.
